# Final Prompt: Seven Continents Travel & Tours Website

> Current direction (29 October 2026): the user has authorized a complete UI/UX and motion improvement across both pages and explicitly requested restoration of the first implementation's contact details and removed content. This supersedes the older placeholder-only contact instructions and staged approval pauses below. Preserve the original services, mission, vision, values, competencies, gallery and planner fields. Restore the original address, phone and social links; record client-confirmation needs in README.md. Keep motion responsive to pointer, touch and keyboard input, and respect reduced-motion preferences.

> Save this file in the project root (for example as `PROMPT.md` or `AGENTS.md`). Follow it exactly and work in the stages described at the end.

## Role

You are a senior front-end developer and designer. Build a **premium, modern website** for **Seven Continents Travel & Tours**, a Manila-based travel agency, replacing their 2016 site. It must feel like a boutique travel brand, not a template, while staying true to the agency's existing identity.

---

## Tech Constraints

- Static site: **plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**.
- **Do not use React, Vue, Next.js, or any framework.** No build step. No booking system.
- Tailwind via CDN is allowed during development. Keep class usage tidy.
- File structure:
  - `index.html`
  - `gallery.html`
  - `css/`
  - `js/main.js`
  - `images/` (already populated with the photos and logo)
  - `references/` (screenshots of the old site, read-only reference)
- The header and footer must be **identical** on both pages.
- Do not modify or delete anything inside `images/` or `references/`.

---

## Step 0: Inspect Before Building

Before writing any code:

1. List everything in `images/` and `references/`.
2. Report what you found, grouped by use: logo, banners/hero candidates, gallery photos by region, client photos, old icons, other.
3. Tell me which files you plan to use for which section.
4. Flag any image that is too small or low-resolution for its intended use (for example the logo), with its pixel dimensions.
5. Wait for my confirmation before continuing.

**Never invent, hotlink, or download images.** Use only what is in `images/`.

---

## Old Site Reference

Screenshots of the current 2016 website are in `references/` (home page, gallery page, and possibly contact page).

Use them **only** for:

- section order and content
- brand identity (logo, blue/green palette, tagline)
- which photos exist and where they were used

Do **not** reproduce:

- the flat orange bands or the geometric pattern backgrounds
- thin light-gray text or white text on orange
- the six stacked carousels on the old gallery page
- the small, low-quality client snapshots as they are
- the contact details shown in the screenshots (they conflict between pages and are outdated). Use the placeholders below instead.

The new design should feel like a premium upgrade of this brand, not a copy of it. Do not use the screenshots as image sources.

| Primary blue | `#3189C9` |
| Secondary green | `#2BAA3B` |
| Accent orange | `#F5A800` (buttons only) |
| Deep navy | `#0F2A43` (footer and one feature section) |

## Design Direction

- Premium and editorial: large type, generous whitespace, max text width about 65 characters.
- Rounded cards (12-16px), soft shadows, smooth hover lifts.
- Subtle motion only:
  - fade-up on scroll (IntersectionObserver)
  - slow zoom on the hero image
  - no auto-playing carousels, no heavy animation libraries
- Sticky header that becomes translucent and blurred on scroll. Hamburger menu on mobile.
- **High-contrast text everywhere.** No thin light-gray text. No white text on orange.
- Mobile-first and fully responsive.
- Orange is used only for primary buttons. Blue and green carry the brand.
- Consistent image aspect ratios and a consistent look across all photos.

---

## Icons

- Use **Lucide icons only**, as inline SVG. No icon fonts, no external image files, no icons copied from the old site.
- One consistent stroke width (1.5).
- Brand blue on light backgrounds, white on dark backgrounds.
- Mark decorative icons `aria-hidden="true"`.

| Service | Icon |
|---|---|
| Air, Sea and Land Travel Reservations | suitcase |
| Hotel Bookings | bed |
| Ticketing/E-Tickets | ticket |
| Travel Documentation Services | file-text |
| Ground Transportation (Car/Bus Rentals, Train Tickets) | car |
| Domestic Flights/Packaged Tours | plane |
| Foreign Tours/Land Arrangements | globe |
| Travel Insurance | shield-check |
